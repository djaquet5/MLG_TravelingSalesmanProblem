# THE BURMAN TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM (TSP)

The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science [Wikipedia].

The objective of this exercise is to solve the TSP problem for a set of 14 cities in Burma, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. The following vectors give the GPS position of each city.

```
LAT = [16.47, 16.47, 20.09, 22.39, 25.23, 22.00, 20.47, 
       17.20, 16.30, 14.05, 16.53, 21.52, 19.41, 20.09]

LON = [96.10, 94.44, 92.54, 93.37, 97.24, 96.05, 97.02, 
       96.29, 97.38, 98.12, 97.38, 95.59, 97.13, 94.55]
```
  
Consider that the distance between two cities is not the Euclidean distance. You have to consider that they are points on the surface of the Earth, which can be considered to be an oblate spheroid.

In this application, we are interested in getting the best solution as possible (e.g., the shortest path). However, notice that we do not know the optimal solution beforehand, so you have to try the GA several times to check if there is a better solution. In this experiment we are not evaluating the capabilities of the Genetic Algorithm, so you do not have to test it using different parameters (mutation and crossover rates, population, etc) to show this, but you may need to try different parameters to be able to find a better solution to your problem.I hope this is clear sourire
